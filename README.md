# Audio to Video Converter

This free, easy-to-use application converts audio files into video files by adding a fixed cover image. Itâ€™s perfect for podcasters, musicians, educators, and content creators who want to upload audio content to platforms like YouTube. Each video features a custom resolution, a black background if needed, and plays the selected audio over a static image. This tool is ideal for turning podcasts, songs, voiceovers, or other audio content into shareable video formats quickly and easily.
